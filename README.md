# soundcloud-chrome-extension
This chrome extension adds tools to soundcloud to make for a better user experience.

TODO:
-Add Hide Button to every listing as new pages appear

-Add a button at the end of each page to delete that page

-Think of a way to automatically delete listings, either after listening, having already listened, or if you've liked/shared

-Add settings to delete reposts, already liked/shared

-Look into download button to add mp3 tags such as artist, genre, and title

-Add link somewhere to get the album cover
