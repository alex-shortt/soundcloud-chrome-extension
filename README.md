# soundcloud-chrome-extension
This chrome extension allows you to download soundcloud songs by pressing the added download button, as well as editing the mp3 metadata right in your browser.

TODO:

-Fix css of input boxes, a bit shaky

-Allow for scraping to find songs

-Download playlist by sending json object with all theurls, open a page on node allowing for a link of each song in playlist

-Analytics

-Publish v1!


---Performance stuff, maybe not for this extension---

-Add Hide Button to every listing as new pages appear

-Add a button at the end of each page to delete that page

-Think of a way to automatically delete listings, either after listening, having already listened, or if you've liked/shared

-Add settings to delete reposts, already liked/shared
